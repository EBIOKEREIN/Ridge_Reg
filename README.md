In this project, I will predict future season stats for baseball players. Specifically, I will predict the wins above replacement (WAR) a player will generate next season. I will first download baseball season data using pybaseball and clean it. I will do feature selection using a sequential feature selector to identify the most promising predictors for machine learning. I will then train a ridge regression model to predict future season WAR. I will measure error and improve the model.

At the end, I will have a model that can predict future season WAR, along with next steps to improve the model.
